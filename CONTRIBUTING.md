# How to contribute

## Introduction

This repository contains the sources to automatically create a tutorial driven documentation for [Gridap](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl) project.

You can visit the latest stable version of this documentation [here](https://gridap.github.io/Tutorials/stable/).

Please, read this document as a starting point before a contribution.

## Automatic generation

[Tutorials web page](https://gridap.github.io/Tutorials/stable/) is automatically generated by using [Literate.jl](https://github.com/fredrikekre/Literate.jl) package. 

Please, follow their rules and conventions to alternate comments and source code.

## Add a new tutorial

1. Add a new Julia script to `src` directory.
2. Add a new `(Title,filename)` pair to `files` array in [deps/build.jl](https://github.com/gridap/Tutorials/blob/master/deps/build.jl) file.

Tutorial headers will be auto generated using the specified `Title`.
