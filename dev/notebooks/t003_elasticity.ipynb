On the other hand, the first component of the displacement vector is prescribed to the value $\\delta\\doteq 5$mm on the surface $\\Gamma_{\\rm B}$, which is marked in blue.

However, the implementation of this numerical scheme is still done in a user-friendly way since all these features can be easily accounted for with the abstractions in the library.\n",
