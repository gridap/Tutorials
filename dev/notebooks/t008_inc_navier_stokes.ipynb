    "The goal of this last tutorial is to solve a nonlinear multi-field PDE. As a model problem, we consider a well known benchmark in computational fluid dynamics, the lid-driven cavity for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Formally, the PDE we want to solve is: find the velocity vector $u$ and the pressure $p$ such that\n",
