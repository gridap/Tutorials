    "## Problem statement\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to solve a scalar electromagnetic wave scattering problem: a plane wave (Hz-polarized $H_{inc}$) scattering of a dielectric cylinder (of radius $R$ and permittivity $\\varepsilon$), as illustrated below. The computational cell is of height $H$ and length $L$, and we employ a perfectly matched layer (PML) thickness of $d_{pml}$ to implement outgoing (radiation) boundary conditions for this finite domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../assets/emscatter/Illustration.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "From Maxwell's equations, considering a time-harmonic electromagnetic field, we can derive the governing equation of this problem in 2D (Helmholtz equation) [1]:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\left[-\\nabla\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon(x)}\\nabla -k^2\\mu(x)\\right] H = f(x),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $k=\\omega/c$ is the wave number in free space and $f(x)$ is the source term (which corresponds to a magnetic current density in Maxwell's equations).\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to simulate this scattering problem in a finite computation cell, we need outgoing (radiation) boundary conditions such that all waves at the boundary would not be reflected back since we are simulating an infinite space.\n",
    "One commonly used technique to simulate such infinite space is through the so called \"perfectly matched layers\" (PML) [2]. Actually, PML is not a boundary condition but an artificial absorbing \"layer\" that absorbs waves with minimal reflections (going to zero as the resolution increases).\n",
    "There are many formulations of PML. Here, we use one of the most flexible formulations, the \"stretched-coordinate\" formulation, which takes the following replace in the PDE [3]:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\rightarrow \\frac{1}{1+\\mathrm{i}\\sigma(u_x)/\\omega}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x},\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $u_{x/y}$ is the depth into the PML, $\\sigma$ is a profile function (here we chose $\\sigma(u)=\\sigma_0(u/d_{pml})^2$) and different derivative corresponds to different absorption directions.\n",
    "Note that at a finite mesh resolution, PML reflects some waves, and the standard technique to mitigate this is to \"turn on\" the PML absorption gradually—in this case we use a quadratic profile. The amplitude $\\sigma_0$ is chosen so that in the limit of infinite resolution the \"round-trip\" normal-incidence is some small number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since PML absorbs all waves in $x/y$ direction, the associated boundary condition is then usually the zero Dirichlet boundary condition. Here, the boundary conditions are zero Dirichlet boundary on the top and bottom side $\\Gamma_D$ but periodic boundary condition on the left ($\\Gamma_L$) and right side ($\\Gamma_R$).\n",
    "The reason that we use a periodic boundary condition for the left and right side instead of zero Dirichlet boundary condition is that we want to simulate a plane wave excitation, which then requires a periodic boundary condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider $\\mu(x)=1$ (which is mostly the case in electromagnetic problems) and denote $\\Lambda=\\operatorname{diagm}(\\Lambda_x,\\Lambda_y)$ where $\\Lambda_{x/y}=\\frac{1}{1+\\mathrm{i}\\sigma(u_{x/y})/\\omega}$, we can formulate the problem as\n",
