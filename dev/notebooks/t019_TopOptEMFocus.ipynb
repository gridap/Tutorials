    "\n",
    "Consider the following optimization problem adapted from [Christiansen et al. (2020)](http://doi.org/10.1364/OE.28.004444):\n",
    "We want to design a metallic (silver) nanoparticle to focus an incident $H_z$-polarized planewave on\n",
    "a single spot, maximizing the electric-field intensity at this focal spot.   The metallic\n",
    "structure can be *any shape* of *any topology* (any connectivity, number of holes, etcetera)\n",
    "surrounding the focal spot, as long as the metal lies within an annular \"design region\" $\\Omega_d$:\n",
    "between a minimum radius $r_s = 10$nm (the minimum distance from the focal spot) and an outer\n",
    "radius $r_d=100$nm.  The computational cell is of height $H$ and length $L$, and we employ a perfectly matched layer (PML) thickness of $d_{pml}$ to implement outgoing (radiation) boundary conditions for this finite domain.\n",
    "![](../assets/TopOptEMFocus/Illustration.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is find the arrangement of the silver material in the gray region that maximizes the |electric field|² at the center (the focal point). Every \"pixel\" in the gray region is effectively treated as a degree of freedom that can vary continuously between silver (shown in black below) and air (shown in white below). This is called density-based [topology optimization (TO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology_optimization), and leads to a tractable optimization problem despite the huge number of parameters. A standard \"projection\" technique, described below, is used to \"binarize\" the structure by eventually forcing the material to be either silver or air almost everywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "From Maxwell's equations, considering a time-harmonic electromagnetic field polarized so that the electric field is in-plane and the magnetic field is out-of-plane (described by a scalar $H$ equal to the z-component), we can derive the governing equation of this problem in 2D (Helmholtz equation) [1]:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\left[-\\nabla\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon(x)}\\nabla -k^2\\mu(x)\\right] H = f(x),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $k=\\omega/c$ is the wave number in free space and $f(x)$ is the source term (which corresponds to a magnetic current density in Maxwell's equations).\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to simulate this scattering problem in a finite computational domain, we need outgoing (radiation) boundary conditions to prevent waves from reflecting back from the boundaries of the domain.  We employ the well-known technique of \"perfectly matched layers\" (PML) [2], which are an an artificial absorbing layer adjacent to the boundaries that absorbs waves with minimal reflections (going to zero as the resolution increases). The \"stretched-coordinate\" formulation of PML correspond to a simple transformation of the PDE [3]:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\rightarrow \\frac{1}{1+\\mathrm{i}\\sigma(u_x)/\\omega}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\rightarrow \\frac{1}{1+\\mathrm{i}\\sigma(u_y)/\\omega}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $u_{x/y}$ is the depth into the PML, $\\sigma$ is a profile function (here we chose $\\sigma(u)=\\sigma_0(u/d_{pml})^2$) and the $x$ and $y$ derivatives correspond PML layers at the $x$ and $y$ boundaries, respectively.  Note that at a finite mesh resolution, PML reflects some waves, and the standard technique to mitigate this is to \"turn on\" the PML absorption gradually—in this case we use a quadratic profile. The amplitude $\\sigma_0$ is chosen so that in the limit of infinite resolution the \"round-trip\" normal-incidence is some small number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since PML absorbs all waves before they reach the boundary, the associated boundary condition can then be chosen arbitrarily. Here, the boundary conditions are Dirichlet (zero) on the top and bottom sides $\\Gamma_D$ but periodic on the left ($\\Gamma_L$) and right sides ($\\Gamma_R$).  The reason that we use periodic boundary conditions for the left and right side instead of Dirichlet boundary conditions is that we want to simulate a plane wave excitation, so we must choose boundary conditions that are satisfied by this incident wave.  (Because of the anisotropic nature of PML, the PML layers at the $x$ boundaries do not disturb an incident planewave traveling purely in the $y$ direction.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\mu(x)=1$ (materials at optical frequencies have negligible magnetic responses) and denote $\\Lambda=\\operatorname{diagm}(\\Lambda_x,\\Lambda_y)$ where $\\Lambda_{x/y}=\\frac{1}{1+\\mathrm{i}\\sigma(u_{x/y})/\\omega}$. We can then formulate the problem as\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For convenience in the weak form and Julia implementation below, we represent $\\Lambda$ as a vector given by the diagonal entries of the $2 \\times 2$ scaling matrix, in which case $\\Lambda\\nabla$ becomes the elementwise product.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Topology Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "We use density-based topology optimization (TO) to maximize the electric field intensity at the center. In TO, every point in the design domain is a design degree of freedom that can vary continuously between air ($p=0$) and silver ($p=1$), which we discretize into a piece-wise constant parameter space $P$ for the design parameter $p\\in [0,1]$. The material's electric permittivity ε is then given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\varepsilon(p) = \\left[n_{air}+p(n_{metal}-n_{air})\\right]^2,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $n_{air}=1$ and $n_{metal}$ are the refractive indices ($\\sqrt{\\varepsilon}$) of the air and metal, respectively. (It is tempting to simply linearly interpolate the permittivities ε, rather than the refractive indices, but this turns out to lead to artificial singularities in the case of metals where ε can pass through zero [4].)\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, to avoid obtaining arbitrarily fine features as the spatial resolution is increased, one needs to regularize the problem with a minimum length-scale $r_f$ by generating a smoothed/filtered parameter function $p_f$.  (Although this regularizes the problem, strictly speaking it does not impose a minimum feature size because of the nonlinear-projection step below. In practical applications, one imposes additional [manufacturing constraints](http://doi.org/10.1364/OE.431188) explicitly.)  We perform the smoothing $p \\to p_f$ by solving a simple \"damped diffusion\" PDE, also called a Helmholtz filter [5], for $p_f$ given the design variables $p$:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "-r_f^2\\nabla^2p_f+p_f&=p\\, ,\\\\\n",
    "\\left. \\frac{\\partial p_f}{\\partial \\vec{n}} \\right\\vert_{\\partial\\Omega_D} & =0 .\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We choose a filter radius $r_f=R_f/(2\\sqrt{3})$ where $R_f=10$ nm, in order to match a published result (using a slightly different filtering scheme) for comparison [6].\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we apply a smoothed threshold projection to the intermediate variable $p_f$ to obtain a \"binarized\" density parameter $p_t$ that tends towards values of $0$ or $1$ almost everywhere [6] as the steepness $\\beta$ of the thresholding is increased:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p_t = \\frac{\\tanh(\\beta\\eta)+\\tanh\\left[\\beta(p_f-\\eta)\\right]}{\\tanh(\\beta\\eta)+\\tanh\\left[\\beta(1-\\eta)\\right]}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Note that as $\\beta\\to\\infty$, this threshold procedure goes to a step function, which would make the optimization problem non-differentiable. In consequence, the standard approach is to gradually increase $\\beta$ to slowly binarize the design as the optimization progresses [6]. We will show how this is done below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we replace $p$ with the filtered and thresholded $p_t$ in the ε interpolation formula from above:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\varepsilon(p_t) = \\left[n_{air}+p_t(n_{metal}-n_{air})\\right]^2,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "This is the quantity that will be used for the $1/\\varepsilon(x)$ coefficient in our Helmholtz PDE.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Weak form\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we derive the weak form of the PML Helmholtz PDE above. After integration by parts (in which the boundary term vanishes), we obtain:\n",
