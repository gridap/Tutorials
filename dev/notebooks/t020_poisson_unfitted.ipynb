    "The next step is to generate the embedded geometry. The most straightforward way to represent the geometry is with the level-set method. It amounts to represent a closed curve (2D) or surface (3D) $\\Gamma$ using an auxiliary function $\\psi$, called the level-set function. $\\Gamma$ is represented as the zero-level-set of $\\psi$ by\n",

    "[GridapEmbedded](https://github.com/gridap/GridapEmbedded.jl) offers out-of-the-box level set surface descriptions for the `disk`, `cylinder`, `sphere`, `square`, `tube`, among others. You can also implement your own level-set function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, you can also construct complex domains from simple level-set descriptions. This is done by translating Boolean set operations and geometric transformations into simple manipulations of the level-set functions. For instance, given two level-set functions $\\psi_1$ and $\\psi_2$, representing the domains $\\Omega_1$ and $\\Omega_2$, the level-set function $\\psi = \\min(\\psi_1,\\psi_2)$ gives the domain $\\Omega_1 \\cup \\Omega_2$.\n",
