At this point, the reader should keep in mind that the finite element method works with global spaces of functions which are defined piece-wise on each cell of the triangulation. In a nutshell (more in the sections below), a `CellField`, as it being a subtype of `CellDatum`, might be understood as a collection of `Field`s (or arrays made out them) per each triangulation cell. `Field` represents a [field](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(physics)), e.g., a scalar, vector, or tensor field. Thus, the domain of a `Field` are points in the physical domain (represented by a type `Point` in `Gridap`, which is a `VectorValue` with a dimension matching that of the environment space) and the range is a scalar, vector (represented by `VectorValue`) or tensor (represented by `TensorValue`)."

Thus, `CellField` (as a sub-type of `CellDatum`) has the `DomainStyle` metadata that is used, e.g., for point-wise evaluations (as indicated above) of the fields and their derivatives (by implementing the transformations when taking a differential operators, e.g., the pull-back of the gradients)."

The rationale is that, by means of the Julia [broadcasting](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/arrays/#Broadcasting) of the `*` operation on these two arrays, we get the 9x4x4 array where the `[i,j,k]` entry stores the product of the j-th test and k-th trial functions, both evaluated at the i-th quadrature point.

    "1. To keep memory allocation (and consumption) at very low levels, `lazy_map` NEVER returns an array that stores the result at all cells at once. In the two examples above, this is achieved using `Fill` arrays. However, this is only possible in very particular scenarios (see discussion above). In more general cases, the array resulting from `lazy_map` does not have the same entry in all cells. In such cases, `lazy_map` returns a `LazyArray`, which is another essential component of `Gridap`. In a nutshell, a `LazyArray` is an array that applies entry-wise arrays of `Map`s (functions, operations) over array(s) that provide the `Map`s arguments. These operations are only computed when accessing the corresponding index, thus the name lazy. Besides, the entries of these are computed in an efficient way, using a set of mechanisms that will be illustrated below with examples (e.g., using cache to store the entry-wise data without the need to allocate memory each time we access the `LazyArray`)."

A `Map` (or its sub-type `Field`) can be applied via `lazy_map` to other `Map`s (or arrays of `Map`s) to build a new `Map` (or array of `Map`s). Thus, the recursive application of `lazy_map` lets us build complex operation trees among arrays of `Map`s as the ones required for the implementation of variational forms. While building these trees, by virtue of Julia support for multiple type dispatching, there are plenty of opportunities for optimization by changing the order in which the operations are performed. These optimizations typically come in the form of a significant saving of FLOPs by exploiting the particular properties of the `Map`s at hand, but could also come from higher granularity for vectorized array operations when the expressions are actually evaluated. Indeed, the arrays that one usually obtains from `lazy_map` differ in some cases from the trivial `LazyArray`s that one would expect from a naive combination of the arguments to `lazy_map`"

This should not come as a surprise as we have that: (1) the restriction of the FE function to a given cell is mathematically defined as a linear combination of the local shape functions of the cell (with coefficients given by the values of the DOFs at the cell). (2) As observed in the previous section, the shape functions are such that their value at `Point`s that are mapped from the reference cell to the physical cell by the cell geometrical map can be simply be obtained by evaluating the corresponding shape function in the reference FE at the same `Point`s in the parametric space (without the need to compute the geometrical map and its inverse, i.e., exploiting the fact that the combination of this two is the identity map).

In a nutshell, this cache can be thought as a place-holder of work arrays that can be re-used among different evaluations of the entries of the `LazyArray` (e.g., the work array in which the result of the computation of an entry of the array is stored.) This way, the code is more performant, as the cache avoids that these work arrays are created repeatedly when traversing the `LazyArray` and computing its entries. It turns out that `LazyArray`s are not the only objects in `Gridap` that (can) work with caches. `Map` and `Field` objects also provide caches for reusing temporary storage among their repeated evaluation on different arguments of the same types. (For the eager reader, the cache can be obtained out of a `Map`/`Field` with the `return_cache` abstract method; see also `return_type`, `return_value`, and `evaluate!` functions of the abstract API of `Map`s). When a `LazyArray` is created out of objects that in turn rely on caches (e.g., a `LazyArray` with entries defined as the entry-wise application of a `Map` to two `LazyArrays`), the caches of the latter objects are also handled by the former object, so that this scheme naturally accommodates top-down recursion, as per-required in the evaluation of complex operation trees among arrays of `Field`s, and their evaluation at a set of `Point`s. We warn the reader this is a quite complex mechanism. The reader is encouraged to follow with a debugger, step by step, the execution of the `smart_sum` function with the `LazyArray`s built above in order to gain some familiarity with this mechanism."

The first array provides the FE function DOF values restricted to each cell, and the second the local basis shape functions evaluated at the quadrature points. As the shape functions in physical space have the same values in all cells at the corresponding mapped points in physical space, there is no need to re-evaluate them at each cell, we can evaluate them only once. And this is what the second `Fill` array stores as its unique entry, i.e., a matrix `M[i,j]` defined as the value of the j-th `Field` (i.e., shape function) evaluated at the i-th `Point`. *This is indeed the main optimization that `lazy_map` applies compared to our manual construction of `uₕ_array_at_qₖ`.* It is worth noting that, if `v` denotes the linear combination coefficients, and `M` the matrix resulting from the evaluation of an array of `Fields` at a set of `Points`, with `M[i,j]` being the value of the j-th `Field` evaluated at the i-th point, the evaluation of `LinearCombinationMap{Colon}` at `v` and `M` returns a vector `w` with `w[i]` defined as `w[i]=sum_k v[k]*M[i,k]`, i.e., the FE function evaluated at the i-th point. `uₕ_array_at_qₖ` handles the cache of `LinearCombinationMap{Colon}` (which holds internal storage for `w`) and that of the first `LazyArray`, so that when it retrieves the DOF values `v` of a given cell, and then applies `LinearCombinationMap{Colon}` to `v` and `M`, it does not have to allocate any temporary working arrays, but re-uses the ones stored in the different caches."

    "2. `manual_uₕ_array_at_qₖ` is also a `LazyArray`, but structured rather differently to `uₕ_array_at_qₖ`.

The evaluation of a `LinearCombinationField` on a set of `Point`s ultimately depends on `LinearCombinationMap`. As seen in the previous point, the evaluation of this `Map` requires a vector `v` and a matrix `M`. `v` was built in-situ when building each `LinearCombinationField`, and stored within these instances. However, in contrast to `uₕ_array_at_qₖ`, `M` is not part of `manual_uₕ_array_at_qₖ`, and thus it has to be (re-)computed each time that we evaluate a new `LinearCombinationField` instance on a set of points. This is the main source of difference on the computation times observed. By eagerly constructing our array of `LinearCombinationField`s instead of deferring it until (lazy) evaluation via `lazy_map`, we lost optimization opportunities. We stress that `manual_uₕ_array_at_qₖ` also handles the cache of `LinearCombinationField` (that in turn handles the one of `LinearCombinationMap`), so that we do not need to allocate `M` at each cell, we re-use the space within the cache of `LinearCombinationField`."

The leitmotif of `Gridap` is *laziness*. When building new arrays of `Field`s (or arrays of `Field`s), out of existing ones, or when evaluating them at a set of `Point`s, ALWAYS use `lazy_map`. This may expand across several recursion levels when building complex operation trees among arrays of `Field`s. The more we defer the actual computation of the entries of `LazyArray`s, the more optimizations will be available at the `Gridap`'s disposal by re-arranging the order of operations via exploitation of the particular properties of the arrays at hand. And this is indeed what we are going to do in the rest of the tutorial, namely calling `lazy_map` to build new cell arrays out of existing ones, to end in a lazy cell array whose entries are the cell matrices and cell vectors contributions to the global linear system."

A code that strictly sticks to this principle is much more readable. Due to laziness, `Gridap` objects are light-weight, and the (lazy) modification of existing (lazy) objects is highly efficient. You can find this action many times in the code above, in which we use `lazy_map` to perform actions over lazy objects (e.g., `LazyArray` or `Fill` arrays) to create new lazy objects. However, strictly conforming to immutability can be inefficient in some very specific scenarios. `Gridap` departs from immutability in the linear algebra part, since we want to re-use the memory allocation as much as possible for global arrays or symbolic/numeric factorisations in linear solvers."
