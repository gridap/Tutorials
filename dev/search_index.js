In the two examples above, this is achieved using Fill arrays. However, this is only possible in very particular scenarios (see discussion above). In more general cases, the array resulting from lazy_map does not have the same entry in all cells. In such cases, lazy_map returns a LazyArray, which is another essential component of Gridap. In a nutshell, a LazyArray is an array that applies entry-wise arrays of Maps (functions, operations) over array(s) that provide the Maps arguments. These operations are only computed when accessing the corresponding index, thus the name lazy. Besides, the entries of these are computed in an efficient way, using a set of mechanisms that will be illustrated below with examples (e.g., using cache to store the entry-wise data without the need to allocate memory each time we access the LazyArray).\nApart from Function objects, such as evaluate, lazy_map can also be used to apply Maps to arguments. For example, Broadcasting(*) presented above. A Map (or its sub-type Field) can be applied via lazy_map to other Maps (or arrays of Maps) to build a new Map (or array of Maps). Thus, the recursive application of lazy_map lets us build complex operation trees among arrays of Maps as the ones required for the implementation of variational forms. While building these trees, by virtue of Julia support for multiple type dispatching, there are plenty of opportunities for optimization by changing the order in which the operations are performed. These optimizations typically come in the form of a significant saving of FLOPs by exploiting the particular properties of the Maps at hand, but could also come from higher granularity for vectorized array operations when the expressions are actually evaluated. Indeed, the arrays that one usually obtains from lazy_map differ in some cases from the trivial LazyArrays that one would expect from a naive combination of the arguments to lazy_map\nUsing lazy_map we are hiding thousands of cell loops across the code (as the one for the computation of the element matrices above). As a result, Gridap is much more expressive for cell-wise implementations.","category":"page"},{"location":"pages/t026_poisson_dev_fe/#Exploring-another-type-of-CellField-objects-1","page":"26 Low-level API - Poisson equation","title":"Exploring another type of CellField objects","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"pages/t026_poisson_dev_fe/#","page":"26 Low-level API - Poisson equation","title":"26 Low-level API - Poisson equation","text":"Let us now work with another type of CellField objects, the ones that are used to represent an arbitrary element of a global FE space of functions, i.e., a FE function.

In particular, its entries are defined as the result of applying a plain array of LinearCombinationFields to a Fill array of Points that holds the coordinates of the quadrature rule evaluation points in the parametric space of the reference cell (which are equivalent for all cells, thus the Fill array). The evaluation of a LinearCombinationField on a set of Points ultimately depends on LinearCombinationMap. As seen in the previous point, the evaluation of this Map requires a vector v and a matrix M. v was built in-situ when building each LinearCombinationField, and stored within these instances. However, in contrast to uₕ_array_at_qₖ, M is not part of manual_uₕ_array_at_qₖ, and thus it has to be (re-)computed each time that we evaluate a new LinearCombinationField instance on a set of points. This is the main source of difference on the computation times observed. By eagerly constructing our array of LinearCombinationFields instead of deferring it until (lazy) evaluation via lazy_map, we lost optimization opportunities. We stress that manual_uₕ_array_at_qₖ also handles the cache of LinearCombinationField (that in turn handles the one of LinearCombinationMap), so that we do not need to allocate M at each cell, we re-use the space within the cache of LinearCombinationField.","category":"page"},{"location":"pages/t026_poisson_dev_fe/#","page":"26 Low-level API - Poisson equation","title":"26 Low-level API - Poisson equation","text":"To conclude the section, we expect the reader to be convinced of the negative consequences in performance that an eager (early) evaluation of the entries of the array returned by a lazy_map call can have in performance. The leitmotif of Gridap is laziness. When building new arrays of Fields (or arrays of Fields), out of existing ones, or when evaluating them at a set of Points, ALWAYS use lazy_map. This may expand across several recursion levels when building complex operation trees among arrays of Fields. The more we defer the actual computation of the entries of LazyArrays, the more optimizations will be available at the Gridap's disposal by re-arranging the order of operations via exploitation of the particular properties of the arrays at hand. And this is indeed what we are going to do in the rest of the tutorial, namely calling lazy_map to build new cell arrays out of existing ones, to end in a lazy cell array whose entries are the cell matrices and cell vectors contributions to the global linear system.","category":"page"},{"location":"pages/t026_poisson_dev_fe/#","page":"26 Low-level API - Poisson equation","title":"26 Low-level API - Poisson equation","text":"Let us, e.g., build Uₖ manually using this idea.

The last step, e.g., the construction of manual_grad_dv_array, actually translates into the combination of the following calls to lazy_map to build the final transformation:","category":"page"},{"location":"pages/t026_poisson_dev_fe/#","page":"26 Low-level API - Poisson equation","title":"26 Low-level API - Poisson equation","text":"Build array of Fields with the Jacobian transposed at each cell","category":"page"},{"location":"pages/t026_poisson_dev_fe/#","page":"26 Low-level API - Poisson equation","title":"26 Low-level API - Poisson equation","text":"Jt     = lazy_map(Broadcasting(∇),ξₖ)","category":"page"},{"location":"pages/t026_poisson_dev_fe/#","page":"26 Low-level API - Poisson equation","title":"26 Low-level API - Poisson equation","text":"Build array of Fields with the inverse of the Jacobian transposed at each cell","category":"page"},{"location":"pages/t026_poisson_dev_fe/#","page":"26 Low-level API - Poisson equation","title":"26 Low-level API - Poisson equation","text":"inv_Jt = lazy_map(Operation(inv),Jt)","category":"page"},{"location":"pages/t026_poisson_dev_fe/#","page":"26 Low-level API - Poisson equation","title":"26 Low-level API - Poisson equation","text":"Build array of arrays of Fields defined as the broadcasted single contraction of the Jacobian inverse transposed and the gradients of the shape functions in the reference space","category":"page"},{"location":"pages/t026_poisson_dev_fe/#","page":"26 Low-level API - Poisson equation","title":"26 Low-level API - Poisson equation","text":"low_level_manual_gradient_dv_array = lazy_map(Broadcasting(Operation(⋅)),inv_Jt,∇ϕrₖ)","category":"page"},{"location":"pages/t026_poisson_dev_fe/#","page":"26 Low-level API - Poisson equation","title":"26 Low-level API - Poisson equation","text":"As always, we check that all arrays built are are equivalent","category":"page"},{"location":"pages/t026_poisson_dev_fe/#","page":"26 Low-level API - Poisson equation","title":"26 Low-level API - Poisson equation","text":"@test typeof(grad_dv_array) == typeof(manual_grad_dv_array)","category":"page"},{"location":"pages/t026_poisson_dev_fe/#","page":"26 Low-level API - Poisson equation","title":"26 Low-level API - Poisson equation","text":"@test lazy_map(evaluate,grad_dv_array,qₖ) == lazy_map(evaluate,manual_grad_dv_array,qₖ)","category":"page"},{"location":"pages/t026_poisson_dev_fe/#","page":"26 Low-level API - Poisson equation","title":"26 Low-level API - Poisson equation","text":"@test lazy_map(evaluate,grad_dv_array,qₖ) == lazy_map(evaluate,low_level_manual_gradient_dv_array,qₖ)","category":"page"},{"location":"pages/t026_poisson_dev_fe/#","page":"26 Low-level API - Poisson equation","title":"26 Low-level API - Poisson equation","text":"@test lazy_map(evaluate,grad_dv_array,qₖ) == evaluate(grad_dv,Qₕ_cell_point)","category":"page"},{"location":"pages/t026_poisson_dev_fe/#","page":"26 Low-level API - Poisson equation","title":"26 Low-level API - Poisson equation","text":"With the lessons learned so far in this section, it is left as an exercise for the reader to manually build the array that get_data returns when we call it with the CellField object resulting from taking the gradient of uₕ as an argument, i.e., get_data(∇(uₕ)).","category":"page"},{"location":"pages/t026_poisson_dev_fe/#A-low-level-implementation-of-the-residual-integration-and-assembly-1","page":"26 Low-level API - Poisson equation","title":"A low-level implementation of the residual integration and assembly","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"pages/t026_poisson_dev_fe/#","page":"26 Low-level API - Poisson equation","title":"26 Low-level API - Poisson equation","text":"In the rest of the tutorial we aim to solve a Poisson equation with homogeneous source term, i.e., f=0 and non-homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions u=g_0 on Gamma_D, with  Gamma_D being the whole boundary of the model.

Besides, we have to pass the created linear solver object solver to the solve function to override the default linear solver (i.e., a call to the backslash \\ Julia operator).","category":"page"},{"location":"pages/t016_poisson_distributed/#","page":"16 Poisson equation on parallel distributed-memory computers","title":"16 Poisson equation on parallel distributed-memory computers","text":"function main_ex2(rank_partition,distribute)\n  parts  = distribute(LinearIndices((prod(rank_partition),)))\n  options = \"-ksp_type cg -pc_type gamg -ksp_monitor\"\n  GridapPETSc.with(args=split(options)) do\n    domain = (0,1,0,1)\n    mesh_partition = (4,4)\n    model = CartesianDiscreteModel(parts,rank_partition,domain,mesh_partition)\n    order = 2\n    u((x,y)) = (x+y)^order\n    f(x) = -Δ(u,x)\n    reffe = ReferenceFE(lagrangian,Float64,order)\n    V = TestFESpace(model,reffe,dirichlet_tags=\"boundary\")\n    U = TrialFESpace(u,V)\n    Ω = Triangulation(model)\n    dΩ = Measure(Ω,2*order)\n    a(u,v) = ∫( ∇(v)⋅∇(u) )dΩ\n    l(v) = ∫( v*f )dΩ\n    op = AffineFEOperator(a,l,U,V)\n    solver = PETScLinearSolver()\n    uh = solve(solver,op)\n    writevtk(Ω,\"output_path/results_ex2\",cellfields=[\"uh\"=>uh,\"grad_uh\"=>∇(uh)])\n  end\nend\n\nrank_partition = (2,2)\nwith_mpi() do distribute\n  main_ex2(rank_partition,distribute)\nend","category":"page"},{"location":"pages/t016_poisson_distributed/#Third-example:-second-example-GridapP4est.jl-for-mesh-generation-1","page":"16 Poisson equation on parallel distributed-memory computers","title":"Third example: second example + GridapP4est.jl for mesh generation","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"pages/t016_poisson_distributed/#","page":"16 Poisson equation on parallel distributed-memory computers","title":"16 Poisson equation on parallel distributed-memory computers","text":"In this example, we define the Cartesian mesh using GridapP4est.jl via recursive uniform refinement starting with a single cell. It only involves minor modifications compared to the previous example. First, one has to generate a coarse mesh of the domain. As the domain is a just a simple box in the example, it suffices to use a coarse mesh with a single quadrilateral fitted to the box in order to capture the geometry of the domain with no geometrical error (see how the coarse_discrete_model object is generated). In more complex scenarios, one can read an unstructured coarse mesh from disk, generated, e.g., with an unstructured brick mesh generator. Second, when building the fine mesh of the domain (see UniformlyRefinedForestOfOctreesDiscreteModel call), one has to specify the number of uniform refinements to be performed on the coarse mesh in order to generate the fine mesh. Finally, when calling with_mpi(f), we do not longer specify a Cartesian partition but just the number of parts.","category":"page"},{"location":"pages/t016_poisson_distributed/#","page":"16 Poisson equation on parallel distributed-memory computers","title":"16 Poisson equation on parallel distributed-memory computers","text":"using GridapP4est\n\nfunction main_ex3(nparts,distribute)\n  parts   = distribute(LinearIndices((nparts,)))\n  options = \"-ksp_type cg -pc_type gamg -ksp_monitor\"\n  GridapPETSc.with(args=split(options)) do\n    domain = (0,1,0,1)\n    coarse_mesh_partition = (1,1)\n    num_uniform_refinements = 2\n    coarse_discrete_model = CartesianDiscreteModel(domain,coarse_mesh_partition)\n    model = UniformlyRefinedForestOfOctreesDiscreteModel(parts,\n                                                       coarse_discrete_model,\n                                                       num_uniform_refinements)\n    order = 2\n    u((x,y)) = (x+y)^order\n    f(x) = -Δ(u,x)\n    reffe = ReferenceFE(lagrangian,Float64,order)\n    V = TestFESpace(model,reffe,dirichlet_tags=\"boundary\")\n    U = TrialFESpace(u,V)\n    Ω = Triangulation(model)\n    dΩ = Measure(Ω,2*order)\n    a(u,v) = ∫( ∇(v)⋅∇(u) )dΩ\n    l(v) = ∫( v*f )dΩ\n    op = AffineFEOperator(a,l,U,V)\n    solver = PETScLinearSolver()\n    uh = solve(solver,op)\n    writevtk(Ω,\"output_path/results_ex3\",cellfields=[\"uh\"=>uh,\"grad_uh\"=>∇(uh)])\n  end\nend\n\nnparts = 4\nwith_mpi() do distribute\n  main_ex3(nparts,distribute)\nend","category":"page"},{"location":"pages/t016_poisson_distributed/#Fourth-example:-second-example-GridapGmsh.jl-for-mesh-generation-1","page":"16 Poisson equation on parallel distributed-memory computers","title":"Fourth example: second example + GridapGmsh.jl for mesh generation","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"pages/t016_poisson_distributed/#","page":"16 Poisson equation on parallel distributed-memory computers","title":"16 Poisson equation on parallel distributed-memory computers","text":"In this example, we want to use an unstructured mesh.
