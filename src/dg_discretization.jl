#
# ## Problem statement
# 
# The goal of this tutorial is to solve a PDE using a Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) formulation. For
# simplicity, we take the Poisson equation on the unit cube $\Omega \doteq
# (0,1)^3$ as the model problem, namely

# ```math
# \left\lbrace
# \begin{aligned}
# -\Delta u = f  \ &\text{in} \ \Omega,\\
# u = g \ &\text{on}\ \Gamma \doteq \partial\Omega,\\
# \end{aligned}
# \right.
# ```
# where $f$ is the source term and $g$ is the prescribed Dirichlet boundary
# function. In this tutorial, we follow the method of manufactured solutions
# since we want to illustrate how to compute discretization errors. We take
# $u(x) = 3 x_1 + x_2^2 + 2 x_3^3 + x_1 x_2 x_3 $ as the exact solution of the
# problem, for which $f(x)= -2 - 12x_3 $ and $g(x) = u(x)$. The selected
# manufactured solution $u$ is a third order multi-variate polynomial, which
# can be represented exactly by the FE discretization that we are going to
# define below. In this scenario, the discretization error has to be close to
# the machine precision. We will use this result to validate the proposed
# implementation.
# 
# ## Numerical Scheme
# 
# We consider a DG formulation to approximate the problem. In particular, we
# consider the symmetric interior penalty method (see, e.g. [1], for specific
# details). For this formulation, the approximation space is made of
# discontinuous piece-wise polynomials, namely
# 
# ```math
# V \doteq \{ v\in L^2(\Omega):\ v|_{T}\in Q_p(T) \text{ for all } T\in\mathcal{T}  \},
# ```
# where $\mathcal{T}$ is the set of all cells $T$ of the FE mesh, and $Q_p(T)$
# is a polynomial space of degree $p$ defined on a generic cell $T$. For
# simplicity, we consider Cartesian meshes in this tutorial. In this case, the
# space $Q_p(T)$ is made of multi-variate polynomials up to degree $p$ in each
# spatial coordinate.
# 
# In order to write the weak form of the problem, we need to introduce some
# notation. The sets of interior and boundary facets associated with the FE
# mesh $\mathcal{T}$ are denoted here as $\mathcal{F}_\Lambda$ and
# $\mathcal{F}_{\Gamma}$ respectively. In addition, for a given
# function $v\in V$ restricted to the interior facets $\mathcal{F}_\Lambda$, we
# introduce the well known jump and mean value operators,
# ```math
# \begin{aligned}
# \lbrack\!\lbrack v\ n \rbrack\!\rbrack &\doteq v^+\ n^+ + v^- n^-,\\
# \{\! \!\{\nabla v\}\! \!\} &\doteq \dfrac{ \nabla v^+ + \nabla v^-}{2},
# \end{aligned}
# ```
# with $v^+$, and $v^-$ being the restrictions of $v\in V$ to the cells $T^+$,
# $T^-$ that share a generic interior facet in $\mathcal{F}_\Lambda$, and $n^+$,
# and $n^-$ are the facet outward unit normals from either the perspective of
# $T^+$ and $T^-$ respectively.
# 
# With this notation, the weak form associated with the interior penalty
# formulation of our problem reads: find $u\in V$ such that $a(u,v) = l(v)$ for
# all $v\in V$. The bilinear and linear forms $a(\cdot,\cdot)$ and $l(\cdot)$
# have contributions associated with the bulk of $\Omega$, the boundary facets
# $\mathcal{F}_{\Gamma}$, and the interior facets $\mathcal{F}_\Lambda$,
# namely
#  ```math
# \begin{aligned}
# a(u,v) &= a_{\Omega}(u,v) + a_{\Gamma}(u,v) + a_{\Lambda}(u,v),\\
# l(v) &= l_{\Omega}(v) + l_{\Gamma}(v).
# \end{aligned}
# ```
# These contributions are defined as
# ```math
# \begin{aligned}
# a_{\Omega}(u,v) &\doteq \sum_{T\in\mathcal{T}} \int_{T} \nabla v \cdot \nabla u \ {\rm d}T,
# \\
# l_{\Omega}(v) &\doteq \int_{\Omega} v\ f \ {\rm d}\Omega,
# \end{aligned}
# ```
# for the volume,
# ```math
# \begin{aligned}
# a_{\Gamma}(u,v) 
#    \doteq  
#    & - \sum_{F\in\mathcal{F}_{\Gamma}} \int_{F} v\ (\nabla u \cdot n)  \ {\rm d}F 
# \\ & - \sum_{F\in\mathcal{F}_{\Gamma}} \int_{F} (\nabla v \cdot n)\ u  \ {\rm d}F
# \\ & + \sum_{F\in\mathcal{F}_{\Gamma}} \dfrac{\gamma}{|F|} \int_{F} v\ u \ {\rm d}F,
# \\
# l_{\Gamma}(v)
# \doteq 
#    & - \sum_{F\in\mathcal{F}_{\Gamma}} \int_{F} (\nabla v \cdot n)\ g  \ {\rm d}F
# \\ & + \sum_{F\in\mathcal{F}_{\Gamma}} \dfrac{\gamma}{|F|} \int_{F} v\ g \ {\rm d}F,
# \end{aligned}
# ```
# for the boundary facets and,
# ```math
# \begin{aligned}
# a_{\Lambda}(u,v) 
# \doteq 
#    & - \sum_{F\in\mathcal{F}_{\Lambda}} \int_{F} \lbrack\!\lbrack v\ n \rbrack\!\rbrack\cdot \{\! \!\{\nabla u\}\! \!\} \ {\rm d}F 
# \\ & - \sum_{F\in\mathcal{F}_{\Lambda}} \int_{F} \{\! \!\{\nabla v\}\! \!\}\cdot \lbrack\!\lbrack u\ n \rbrack\!\rbrack \ {\rm d}F 
# \\ & + \sum_{F\in\mathcal{F}_{\Lambda}} \dfrac{\gamma}{|F|} \int_{F} \lbrack\!\lbrack v\ n \rbrack\!\rbrack\cdot \lbrack\!\lbrack u\ n \rbrack\!\rbrack \ {\rm d}F,
# \end{aligned}
# ```
#  for the interior facets. In previous expressions, $|F|$ denotes the diameter
#  of the face $F$ (in our Cartesian grid, this is equivalent to the
#  characteristic mesh size $h$), and $\gamma$ is a stabilization parameter that
#  should be chosen large enough such that the bilinear form $a(\cdot,\cdot)$ is
#  stable and continuous. Here, we take $\gamma = p\ (p+1)$ as done in the
#  numerical experiments in reference [2].
# 
# ## Manufactured solution
# 
# We start by loading the Gridap library and defining the manufactured solution
# $u$ and the associated source term $f$ and Dirichlet function $g$.

using Gridap
u(x) = 3*x[1] + x[2]^2 + 2*x[3]^3 + x[1]*x[2]*x[3]
f(x) = -2 - 12*x[3] 
g(x) = u(x)
# We also need to define the gradient of $u$ since we will compute the $H^1$
# error norm later. In that case, the gradient is simply defined as

∇u(x) = VectorValue(3        + x[2]*x[3],   
                    2*x[2]   + x[1]*x[3], 
                    6*x[3]^2 + x[1]*x[2])

# In addition, we need to tell the Gridap library that the gradient of the
# function `u` is available in the function `∇u` (at this moment `u` and `∇u`
# are two standard Julia functions without any connection between them). This
# is done by adding an extra method to the function `gradient` (aka `∇`)
# defined in Gridap:

import Gridap: ∇
∇(::typeof(u)) = ∇u

#  Now, it is possible to recover function `∇u` from function `u` as `∇(u)`. You
#  can check that the following expression evaluates to `true`.

∇(u) === ∇u
 
# ## Cartesian mesh generation
#  In order to discretize the geometry of the unit cube, we use the Cartesian mesh generator available in Gridap.

L = 1.0
domain = (0.0, L, 0.0, L, 0.0, L)
n = 4
partition = (n,n,n)
model = CartesianDiscreteModel(domain,partition)

# The type `CartesianDiscreteModel` is a concrete type that inherits from
# `DiscreteModel`, which is specifically designed for building Cartesian
# meshes. The `CartesianDiscreteModel` constructor takes a tuple containing
# limits of the box we want to discretize plus a tuple with the number of cells
# to be generated in each direction (here $4\times4\times4$ cells). You can
# write the model in vtk format to visualize it (see next figure).

mkpath("output_path")
writevtk(model,"output_path/model")

# ![](../assets/dg_discretization/model.png)
# 
#  Note that the `CaresianDiscreteModel` is implemented for arbitrary
#  dimensions. For instance, the following lines build a
#  `CartesianDiscreteModel` for the unit square $(0,1)^2$ with 4 cells per
#  direction

domain2D = (0.0, L, 0.0, L)
partition2D = (n,n)
model2D = CartesianDiscreteModel(domain2D,partition2D)

# You could also generate a mesh for the unit tesseract $(0,1)^4$ (i.e., the
# unit cube in 4D). Look how the 2D and 3D models are built and just follow the
# sequence.
# 
# ## FE spaces
# 
# On top of the discrete model, we create the discontinuous space $V$ as
# follows

order = 3
V = TestFESpace(model,
                ReferenceFE(lagrangian,Float64,order),
                conformity=:L2)

# We have select a Lagrangian, scalar-valued interpolation of order $3$ within
# the cells of the discrete model. Since the cells are hexahedra, the resulting
# Lagrangian shape functions are tri-cubic polynomials. In contrast to previous
# tutorials, where we have constructed $H^1$-conforming (i.e., continuous) FE
# spaces, here we construct a $L^2$-conforming (i.e., discontinuous) FE space.
# That is, we do not impose any type of continuity of the shape function on the
# cell boundaries, which leads to the discontinuous FE space $V$ of the DG
# formulation. Note also that we do not pass any information about the
# Dirichlet boundary to the `TestFESpace` constructor since the Dirichlet
# boundary conditions are not imposed strongly in this example.
# 
# From the `V` object we have constructed in previous code snippet, we build
# the trial FE space as usual.

U = TrialFESpace(V)

# Note that we do not pass any Dirichlet function to the `TrialFESpace`
# constructor since we do not impose Dirichlet boundary conditions strongly
# here.
# 
# ## Numerical integration
#
# Once the FE spaces are ready, the next step is to set up the numerical
# integration. In this example, we need to integrate in three different
# domains: the volume covered by the cells $\mathcal{T}$ (i.e., the
# computational domain $\Omega$), the surface covered by the boundary facets
# $\mathcal{F}_{\Gamma}$ (i.e., the boundary $\Gamma = \partial \Omega$), and
# the surface covered by the interior facets $\mathcal{F}_{\Lambda}$ (i.e. the
# so-called mesh skeleton). In order to integrate in $\Omega$ and on its
# boundary $\Gamma$, we use `Triangulation` and `BoundaryTriangulation` objects
# as already discussed in previous tutorials.

Ω = Triangulation(model)
Γ = BoundaryTriangulation(model)

# Here, we do not pass any boundary identifier to the `BoundaryTriangulation`
# constructor. In this case, an integration mesh for the entire boundary
# $\Gamma$ is constructed by default (which is just what we need in this
# example).
# 
# In order to generate an integration mesh for the interior facets
# $\mathcal{F}_{\Lambda}$, we use a new type of `Triangulation` referred to as
# `SkeletonTriangulation`. It can be constructed from a `DiscreteModel` object
# as follows:

Λ = SkeletonTriangulation(model)

# As any other type of `Triangulation`, an `SkeletonTriangulation` can be
# written into a vtk file for its visualization (see next figure, where the
# interior facets $\mathcal{F}_\Lambda$ are clearly observed).

writevtk(Λ,"output_path/strian")

# ![](../assets/dg_discretization/skeleton_trian.png)
# 
# Once we have constructed the triangulations needed in this example, we define
# the corresponding quadrature rules by passing the triangulations 
# together with the desired degree to the `Measure` function.

degree = 2*order

dΩ = Measure(Ω,degree)
dΓ = Measure(Γ,degree)
dΛ = Measure(Λ,degree)

# We still need a way to represent the unit outward normal vector to the
# boundary $\Gamma$, and the unit normal vector on the interior faces
# $\mathcal{F}_\Lambda$. This is done with the `get_normal_vector` getter.

n_Γ = get_normal_vector(Γ)
n_Λ = get_normal_vector(Λ)

# The `get_normal_vector` getter takes either a boundary or a skeleton
# triangulation and returns an object representing the normal vector to the
# corresponding surface. For boundary triangulations, the returned normal
# vector is the unit outwards one, whereas for skeleton triangulations the
# orientation of the returned normal is arbitrary. In the current
# implementation (Gridap v0.5.0), the unit normal is outwards to the cell with
# smaller id among the two cells that share an interior facet in
# $\mathcal{F}_\Lambda$.
# 
# ## Weak form
#
# With these ingredients we can define the different terms in the weak form.
# First, we start with the terms $a_\Omega(\cdot,\cdot)$ , and
# $l_\Omega(\cdot)$ associated with integrals in the volume $\Omega$. This is
# done as in the tutorial for the Poisson equation.

a_Ω(u,v) = ∫( ∇(v)⊙∇(u) )dΩ 
l_Ω(v) = ∫( v*f )dΩ  

# The terms $a_{\Gamma}(\cdot,\cdot)$ and $l_{\Gamma}(\cdot)$ associated with
# integrals on the boundary $\Gamma$ are defined using an analogous approach:

h = L / n
γ = order*(order+1)
a_Γ(u,v) = ∫( - v*(∇(u)⋅n_Γ) - (∇(v)⋅n_Γ)*u + (γ/h)*v*u )dΓ
l_Γ(v)   = ∫(                - (∇(v)⋅n_Γ)*g + (γ/h)*v*g )dΓ

# Note that in the definition of the functions `a_Γ` and `b_Γ`, we have used
# the object `n_Γ` representing the outward unit normal to the boundary
# $\Gamma$. The code definition of `a_Γ` and `b_Γ` is indeed very close to
# the mathematical definition of the forms $a_{\Gamma}(\cdot,\cdot)$ and
# $b_{\Gamma}(\cdot)$.
# 
# Finally, we need to define the term $a_\Lambda(\cdot,\cdot)$ integrated on
# the interior facets $\mathcal{F}_\Lambda$,

a_Λ(u,v) = ∫( - jump(v*n_Λ)⊙mean(∇(u)) 
              - mean(∇(v))⊙jump(u*n_Λ) 
              + (γ/h)*jump(v*n_Λ)⊙jump(u*n_Λ) )dΛ

# Note that the arguments `v`, `u` of function `a_Λ` represent a test and trial
# function *restricted* to the interior facets $\mathcal{F}_\Lambda$. As
# mentioned before in the presentation of the DG formulation, the restriction
# of a function $v\in V$ to the interior faces leads to two different values
# $v^+$ and $v^-$ . In order to compute jumps and averages of the quantities
# $v^+$ and $v^-$, we use the functions `jump` and `mean`, which represent the
# jump and mean value operators $\lbrack\!\lbrack \cdot \rbrack\!\rbrack$ and
# $\{\! \!\{\cdot\}\! \!\}$ respectively. Note also that we have used the
# object `n_Λ` representing the unit normal vector on the interior facets. As a
# result, the notation used to define function `a_Λ` is very close to the
# mathematical definition of the terms in the bilinear form
# $a_\Lambda(\cdot,\cdot)$.
# 
# Once the different terms of the weak form have been defined, we build and solve the FE problem.
a(u,v) = a_Ω(u,v) + a_Γ(u,v) + a_Λ(u,v)
l(v) = l_Ω(v) + l_Γ(v)

op = AffineFEOperator(a, l, U, V)
uh = solve(op)

# ## Discretization error 
# 
# We end this tutorial by quantifying the discretization error associated with
# the computed numerical solution `uh`. In DG methods a simple error indicator
# is the jump of the computed (discontinuous) approximation on the interior
# faces. We compute and visualize the jump of these values as follows (see next
# figure):

writevtk(Λ,"output_path/jumps",cellfields=["jump_u"=>jump(uh)])

# Note that the jump of the numerical solution is very small, close to the
# machine precision (as expected in this example with manufactured solution).
# ![](../assets/dg_discretization/jump_u.png)
# 
#  A more rigorous way of quantifying the error is to measure it with a norm.
#  Here, we use the $L^2$ and $H^1$ norms, namely
#  ```math
# \begin{aligned}
#  \| w \|_{L^2}^2 & \doteq \int_{\Omega} w^2 \ \text{d}\Omega, \\
#  \| w \|_{H^1}^2 & \doteq \int_{\Omega} w^2 + \nabla w \cdot \nabla w \ \text{d}\Omega.
# \end{aligned}
# ```
# 
# The discretization error can be computed in this example as the difference of
# the manufactured and numerical solutions.

e = u - uh

# We compute the error norms as follows. First, we implement the integrands of
# the norms we want to compute.

l2(u) = sqrt(sum( ∫( u⊙u )*dΩ ))
h1(u) = sqrt(sum( ∫( u⊙u + ∇(u)⊙∇(u) )*dΩ ))

# Then, we compute the corresponding integrals with the `integrate` function.
el2 = l2(e)
eh1 = h1(e)

# The `integrate` function returns a lazy object representing the contribution
# to the integral of each cell in the underlying triangulation. To end up with
# the desired error norms, one has to sum these contributions and take the
# square root. You can check that the computed error norms are close to machine
# precision (as one would expect).

tol = 1.e-10
@assert el2 < tol
@assert eh1 < tol
