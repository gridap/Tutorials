# In this tutorial, we will learn:
#
#    - How to use adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) with Gridap
#    - How to set up a Poisson problem on an L-shaped domain
#    - How to implement error estimation and marking strategies
#    - How to visualize the AMR process and results
#
# ## Problem Overview
#
# We will solve the Poisson equation on an L-shaped domain using adaptive mesh refinement.
# The L-shaped domain is known to introduce a singularity at its reentrant corner,
# making it an excellent test case for AMR. The problem is:
#
# ```math
# \begin{aligned}
# -\Delta u &= f  &&\text{in } \Omega \\
# u &= g &&\text{on } \partial\Omega
# \end{aligned}
# ```
#
# where Ω is the L-shaped domain, and we choose an exact solution with a singularity
# to demonstrate the effectiveness of AMR.
#
# ## Error Estimation and AMR Process
#
# We use a residual-based a posteriori error estimator η. For each element K in the mesh,
# the local error indicator ηK is computed as:
#
# ```math
# \eta_K^2 = h_K^2\|f + \Delta u_h\|_{L^2(K)}^2 + h_K\|\lbrack\!\lbrack \nabla u_h \cdot n \rbrack\!\rbrack \|_{L^2(\partial K)}^2
# ```
#
# where:
# - `h_K` is the diameter of element K
# - `u_h` is the computed finite element solution
# - The first term measures the element residual
# - The second term measures the jump in the normal derivative across element boundaries
#
# The AMR process follows these steps in each iteration:
#
# 1. **Solve**: Compute the finite element solution u_h on the current mesh
# 2. **Estimate**: Calculate error indicators ηK for each element
# 3. **Mark**: Use Dörfler marking to select elements for refinement
#    - Sort elements by error indicator
#    - Mark elements containing a fixed fraction (here 80%) of total error
# 4. **Refine**: Refine selected elements to obtain a new mesh. In this example, 
#    we will be using the newest vertex bisection (NVB) method to keep the mesh 
#    conforming (without any hanging nodes).
#
# This adaptive loop continues until either:
# - A maximum number of iterations is reached
# - The estimated error falls below a threshold
# - The solution achieves desired accuracy
#
# The process automatically concentrates mesh refinement in regions of high error,
# particularly around the reentrant corner where the solution has reduced regularity.
# This results in better accuracy per degree of freedom compared to uniform refinement.

# ## Problem Setup
#
# We define an exact solution that contains a singularity at the corner (0.5, 0.5)
# of the L-shaped domain. This singularity will demonstrate how AMR automatically
# refines the mesh in regions of high error.

ϵ = 1e-2
r(x) = ((x[1]-0.5)^2 + (x[2]-0.5)^2)^(1/2)
u_exact(x) = 1.0 / (ϵ + r(x))

# Create an L-shaped domain by removing a quadrant from a unit square.
# The domain is [0,1]² \ [0.5,1]×[0.5,1]

  model = CartesianDiscreteModel((0,1,0,1),(n,n))
  cell_coords = map(mean,get_cell_coordinates(model))

  mask = map(l_shape_filter,cell_coords)
  model = simplexify(DiscreteModelPortion(model,mask))

  grid = get_grid(model)
  topo = get_grid_topology(model)
  return UnstructuredDiscreteModel(grid, topo, FaceLabeling(topo))
end

# Define the L2 norm for error estimation.
# These will be used to compute both local and global error measures.
l2_norm(he,xh,dΩ) = ∫(he*(xh*xh))*dΩ
l2_norm(xh,dΩ) = ∫(xh*xh)*dΩ

# ## AMR Step Function
#
# The `amr_step` function performs a single step of the adaptive mesh refinement process:
# 1. Solves the Poisson problem on the current mesh
# 2. Estimates the error using residual-based error indicators
# 3. Marks cells for refinement using Dörfler marking
# 4. Refines the mesh using newest vertex bisection (NVB)

# In this tutorial, we have demonstrated how to:
# 1. Implement adaptive mesh refinement for the Poisson equation
# 2. Use residual-based error estimation to identify regions needing refinement

# The results show how AMR automatically refines the mesh near the singularity,
# leading to more efficient and accurate solutions compared to uniform refinement.
